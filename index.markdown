Political Analysis requires authors of conditionally accepted manuscripts to provide complete replication materials before publication. This ensures that all findings are reproducible.

For a detailed list of requirements and instructions on how to submit, see the full **[Replication Guidelines (PDF)](replication_guidelines.pdf)**. For questions, contact: **political.analysis.replications@gmail.com**.


## **Replication Checklist**
To ensure timely replication of your materials, complete the following checklist before submitting your materials.

#### **Run File (`run.sh`)** — [Example](https://pa-replication.github.io/example/#run-file-runsh)

A script (e.g., `.R`, `.py`, `.sh`) that executes all analyses in the correct order.  

#### **Log File**:  — [Example](https://pa-replication.github.io/example/#log-file)
A log of the output from a complete run of the analysis, generated by executing the run file.  

#### **Figures & Outputs**:  -[Example](https://pa-replication.github.io/example/#figures-and-outputs)
All tables and figures from the complete run should be included.  
(Timestamps for the figures should be consistent with the timestamp for the log file.)  

#### **Compute & Runtime Details**:  
In the run file, note the approximate runtime for each script, as well as the compute used (number of cores and required RAM).  

#### **Data & Code**:  
Clearly documented datasets and analysis scripts.
