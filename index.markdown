# Political Analysis Replication Guidelines

Political Analysis requires authors of conditionally accepted manuscripts to provide complete **replication materials** before publication. This ensures that all findings are reproducible. The **replication team** verifies compliance before final acceptance.

## **Replication Checklist**
To meet the replication requirements, authors must provide:

✔️ **Run File**: A script (e.g., `.R`, `.py`, `.sh`) that executes all analyses in the correct order.  
✔️ **Log File**: A log from a full run of the analysis.  
✔️ **Figures & Outputs**: All tables and figures generated.  
✔️ **Compute & Runtime Details**: Total execution time and required computing resources.  
✔️ **Data & Code**: Clearly documented datasets and analysis scripts.  

## **General Requirements**
- Replication materials must be **sufficient to reproduce** the study’s results.
- Documentation should be **clear and structured** for future researchers.
- If data access is restricted, authors must notify the editor upon submission.

## **Submission Process**
1. **Prepare**: Organize the replication package, ensuring all components run smoothly.  
2. **Upload**: Submit the package to [Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/pan) or [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/).  
3. **Verify**: The **replication team** will test the materials.  
4. **Approval**: Once verified, the replication is finalized, and the manuscript moves forward.  

## **Best Practices**
- Use **open-source software** whenever possible.
- Include a **README file** following [this template](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/).
- Ensure **code is automated**, requiring minimal manual intervention.
- If using **restricted-access data**, provide as much public code as possible.
